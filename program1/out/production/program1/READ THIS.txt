For some reason printing 100000 elements 4 times wont show all of it after its done running. So my screenshots are proving that the arrays are sorted each time the same through each class. And proving that I timed the sorts at 100000 elements. Then I added another screenshot that shows 10000 elements being sorted because it shows that many after running. So its a little broken up but should get the point across.
